# Introduction
We present four datasets and describe the methodology used to create these datasets along with supplementary source datasets and Python codes from which the four datasets were developed. The key idea behind the datasets is to connect them in terms of a group of products with similarities, which we denote as ’Product Families’. For instance, soy milk, almond milk, skim milk, whole milk, etc. are grouped into one product family named ’Milk.’ This allows us to organize data and make connections across in-store and online customer channels and among multiple data sources. Also, because individual products change frequently in grocery stores, but the product families tend to have similar characteristics, this allows for a more manageable data unit than gathering data at the individual item levels.

# Omnichannel-Retail-Datasets
Our datasets include -
(1) a mapping of product families between two different data sources 
(2) demand and shopping behavior for each product family for online and in-store customers; 
(3) product dimension, weight, and price for each product family; and lastly, 
(4) in-store customer and online order arrival rates on a granular level, specifically, per hour
and day of the week level.
